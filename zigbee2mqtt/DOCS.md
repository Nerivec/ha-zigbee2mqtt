# Home Assistant Add-on: Zigbee2MQTT

## How to use

[Onboarding](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/getting-started/#onboarding) allows you to setup Zigbee2MQTT without having to manually enter the details in the add-on configuration page. When starting the add-on with a brand new install (no configuration present), the frontend will show a quick setup page, allowing you to select various settings for Zigbee2MQTT to be able to start.

> [!NOTE]
> Successful detection of adapters, to select from, may vary based on your setup/network. You may have to enter these [details manually](https://www.zigbee2mqtt.io/guide/configuration/adapter-settings.html#basic-configuration) on the page instead.
