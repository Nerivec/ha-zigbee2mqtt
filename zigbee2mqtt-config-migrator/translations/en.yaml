    description: >-
      Slug of the new add-on (can be obtained using the URL of the new add-on: `/hassio/addon/abcd1234_zigbee2mqtt/info` => `abcd1234_zigbee2mqtt`).
      If not supplied, the migrator will try to determine the slug by looking at the installed Zigbee2MQTT add-ons and excluding installs not from this repository (old add-ons).
      If the result contains more than one add-on, the process is aborted and you will have to enter the slug manually.
